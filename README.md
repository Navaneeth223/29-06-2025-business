## 🌐 1. Your Web Development Business Idea
Since it's web-based, here are common directions you could choose:

- 🔹 Build websites for local businesses

- 🔹 Create a SaaS tool (e.g., a PDF editor, QR generator, wallpaper maker—like your past ideas)

- 🔹 Web templates or themes for sale

- 🔹 A platform for college students (event app, notice board, study helper, etc.)

You can choose based on what’s helpful for your college community or local market.

## 🧭 2. Steps to Start the Business
### ✅ Planning
- Define the goal: What problem are you solving?

- Who are the target users (students, teachers, local businesses)?

- Write a 1-page business plan: idea, features, tools, income model (if any)

### ✅ Build a Team (Optional)
- Since you're asked to give stipends & education, include 1–3 interested students who want to learn and help. Choose:

- A designer (UI/UX)

- A developer (or train one)

- A marketing/promoter (can be you!)

### ✅ Tools/Setup
- Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase (free to start)

- Tech Stack: Use your strengths (MERN / Flutter Web / Firebase)

- Organize in GitHub

### 📚 3. What You Must Do for College (Stipend & Education)
Since the principal said you must provide stipend and education:

- 🔸 You need to:
- Mentor students who join you:

- Teach them HTML, CSS, JS, Git, etc.

- You can schedule 1-hour sessions every week.

- Give a small stipend (optional value ideas):

- ₹200–₹500/month (symbolic, or based on college funding)

 - You can ask the college for help or use profits from the business.

- Document their learning (keep a report):

- Track their progress in learning and tasks.

- Show Progress/Demo every month to college (optional)

### 💼 Optional Business Setup for Growth
- If this expands, you can:

- Create a website or portfolio page for your mini business

- Add testimonials from local clients

- Offer internship certificates to team members

- Participate in college events/hackathons
